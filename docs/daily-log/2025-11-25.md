## 2. During the day

**What we focused on:**

- Tried to configure swagger API with no success
- Set up views and routes
- Discussed pinia vs params

**Decisions or changes in planning:**

- We spinned our wheels today, so we made the decision to use tomorrow's classroom time to ask Benjamin for opinions on how to move forward.

**New insights or problems:**

- We were confused with everything surrounding apis, and we got stuck trying to import our existing recipe data to the api via swaggers gui (createDto is required, Title is required [even though we do have a Title in the json] etc.)

- We had trouble figuring out whether we should use Pinia for state management or if we should stick to Vue Router's params functionality. We will ask for guidance during classroom time tomorrow.
