## 2. During the day

**What we focused on:**
- We discussed macro-planning, seeing as we only have about 3 weeks until presentation. We decided to try our best to finish all the remaining components by next week so we can focus on Testing, Routing and Views and putting the site together.
- We decided the recipe rating component should link to the commenting function so that the user has to submit a comment to rate, and can't just submit 100 anonymous reviews if they want.

**Decisions or changes in planning:**

-

**New insights or problems:**
